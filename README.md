## Project Overview

This was one of my earliest game programming experiments, focused on understanding rendering, input handling, and basic audio with SDL2. Unlike my later projects, this engine is kept intentionally lightweight and does **not** follow modern architecture patterns. It was a personal learning journey ‚Äî to get something working on screen and interact with inputs, sprites, and sounds.

## Features

- SDL2 rendering pipeline (sprites, tiles, UI)
- Simple input handling (keyboard)
- Basic audio support (sound effects + music)
- HUD elements like score, health, lives
- Lightweight game loop and structure
- Folder organization for engine, game, and resources
